# Vue Calendar - Tailwind CSS

Features!

  - Displays a simple calendar
  - Move dates forwards and backwards

  - User can select date by clicking on it.

### Tech

The class uses pure javascript but to implement a working example vue.js is used:

* [HTML] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [vue] - Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
* [Tailwind] - A bare-bones Tailwind setup is a single CSS file that looks like this: @tailwind preflight; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities; In CSS, the order of your rule definitions is extremely important. If two rules have the same specificity, the rule defined last is the rule that is applied.

### Installation
 
  - Copy the main.js file into a designated folder
  - import the main.js file into the component you want to use the calendar in. 
  - Copy and paste the html in or create your custom calendar as you see fit. 

### Todos
